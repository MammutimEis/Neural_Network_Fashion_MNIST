## Fashion MNIST
Implementation of a dense Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow

## Files
main.py: creates the dataset and trains the model  
DenseModel.py: 2-layer NN   
CnnModel.py: CNN model with one convolutional layer   
helper.py: functions for main.py   
plot_statistics.py: plots the training results

## How to use?
run main.py to start the training of a neural network.  
The parameters and which model to use can be specified at the top of the file.   
Use plot_statistics.py to plot the results  
The code is written in Python 3 and environment.yml shows a working configuration of packages for the program.
